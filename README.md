LSTM Stock Prediction

Why Use LSTM for Stock Prediction?

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that excel at capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data. Unlike standard RNNs, which suffer from vanishing gradients, LSTMs have a unique gating mechanism that allows them to retain important information over extended periods. This makes them ideal for time-series forecasting, such as stock price prediction, where past trends influence future movements.

How LSTM is Used in This Project

This project utilizes an LSTM model to predict stock prices based on historical data. The key steps include:

Data Preprocessing: Stock price data is collected and normalized using MinMax scaling to improve training efficiency.

Sequence Creation: The data is structured into input sequences and corresponding target values for supervised learning.

Model Training: The LSTM network is trained using Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and optimized with Adam optimizer.

Prediction: Once trained, the model can forecast future stock prices.
